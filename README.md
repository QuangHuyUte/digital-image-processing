## 📘 Description

This repository documents my learning journey in the **Digital Image Processing** course (HCMUTE).  
All exercises, practice files, and experiments are implemented in **Python**, mainly using **OpenCV** and **NumPy** — focusing on image intensity transformations and spatial domain filtering.

The goal of this repository is to **visualize the mathematical principles behind image enhancement**, while experimenting with both GUI-based and programmatic approaches.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

| Category | Tools |
|-----------|--------|
| **Language** | Python 3.12 |
| **Libraries** | `opencv-python`, `numpy`, `customtkinter`, `pillow` |
| **Environment** | Visual Studio Code |

---

## 🧩 Core Topics

- Image reading, displaying, and color conversions (RGB, Grayscale, HSV, YCrCb)  
- Intensity transformations: Log, Gamma, Piecewise-linear  
- Histogram equalization and CLAHE  
- Spatial domain filters: Mean, Gaussian, Median  
- GUI-based image enhancement with adjustable parameters

## 🧠 Learning Focus

> Exploring how mathematical operations on pixel intensity  
> can enhance the visual quality and information content of digital images.

## 📷 Example Project

**Interactive Intensity Transformation GUI**  
Built with `CustomTkinter`, allows real-time tuning of log, gamma, and piecewise-linear parameters —  
showing how these transformations can be stacked while preserving color through luminance (Y-channel) processing.
